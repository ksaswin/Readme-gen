## Inspiration

As mentioned in the introduction, this project is based on an existing app created by [Katherine Peterson](https://github.com/octokatherine).

I used [readme.so](https://readme.so/) to create README files for all my projects. After I learnt the basics of VueJs, I thought this could be the perfect project to recreate/clone, since I personally enjoy using it so much.
